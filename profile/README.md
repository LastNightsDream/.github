# an online dream experiment into our collective unconscious.

“When we wake up in the morning, the night’s dream dissolves, and we say, “Oh, it was only a dream. It wasn’t real.” But something in the dream must have been real; otherwise it could not be. When death approaches, we may look back on our life and wonder if it was just another dream. Even now you may look back on last year’s vacation or yesterday’s drama and see that it is very similar to last night’s dream.”
